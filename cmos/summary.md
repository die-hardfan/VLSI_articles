## Introduction
Advances in electronics have followed Moore’s Law, doubling transistor density roughly every two years while shrinking feature sizes. While design complexity has increased, the technology enabling this scaling—CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)—remains foundational. CMOS dominates digital integrated circuits due to its low power consumption, high noise immunity, and scalability, forming the backbone of modern chips and future semiconductor innovations.

## Evolution of Transistors
The transistor evolved from bulky, inefficient vacuum tubes to solid-state devices. The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) was demonstrated in 1947, and the MOSFET was developed in the early 1960s. Early MOSFETs were slow and unreliable, but advancements in semiconductor theory, controlled doping, planar processing, and photolithography enabled reliable, high-density transistors. These innovations set the stage for the widespread adoption of CMOS logic.

## CMOS Technology
Conceptualized in 1963 by Sah and Wanlass, CMOS uses complementary NMOS and PMOS transistors in pull-down and pull-up networks. Only one network conducts under static conditions, resulting in near-zero static power consumption, a major advantage over NMOS-only or BJT circuits. During switching, both transistors briefly conduct, producing short-circuit power, while dynamic power arises from charging and discharging load capacitances. Overall, CMOS achieves lower power consumption while maintaining reliable high-speed operation.

## CMOS Inverter Basics
The CMOS inverter is the fundamental building block of CMOS logic. When the input is low, PMOS conducts and NMOS is off, producing a high output. When the input rises above the NMOS threshold, NMOS turns on and PMOS turns off, transitioning the output from high to low. This transition produces brief short-circuit current. Capacitive effects can cause overshoot or undershoot during high-frequency switching.

## Scaling and Technology Evolution
As CMOS scaled, challenges like gate leakage and short-channel effects arose. Hi-κ metal gate (HKMG) technology at 45 nm reduced leakage while maintaining threshold control. FinFETs emerged around 22 nm, offering better electrostatic control. By 2023, Gate-All-Around FETs (GAAFETs) were introduced at 3 nm and 2 nm nodes, and next-generation CFETs, stacking n- and p-type transistors vertically, promise higher density and reduced area.
Beyond transistor-level scaling, multi-core processors, heterogeneous SoCs, hardware accelerators, and chiplet-based integration extend performance gains while addressing limits imposed by Amdahl’s law.
