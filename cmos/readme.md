# The CMOS Inverter - The Transistor That Built the Modern World

Advances in electronics have followed Moore's Law, scaling feature sizes every generation and doubling transistor integration capacity every two years, resulting in the complex chips of today. The design complexity has only increased and gets much attention, but the technology that enables the physical conception of the said design is often overlooked. Even as semiconductor technology approaches nanoscale dimensions of just a few atoms across, CMOS remains the first commercially successful and fully established technology for digital integrated circuits, and the basis for future technologies. This article provides a surface-level look at CMOS technology, focusing on its most fundamental building block: the CMOS inverter.

## A Brief History of Transistors (BJT and MOSFET)

The transistor originated from thermionic vacuum tubes, invented in 1907, which were large, fragile, and energy-intensive devices used in radios, TVs, and radar. In the 1920s, Julius Edgar Lilienfeld patented the concept of a solid-state transistor, but the semiconductor technology needed to realize it did not yet exist. The first practical transistors were developed in 1947 by Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley at Bell Labs, with Shockley patenting the first bipolar junction transistor in 1948. It was not until the early 1960s that Atalla and Kahng successfully built a working MOSFET, roughly three decades after Lilienfeld first proposed the idea. The original MOSFETs were slow, unreliable, and prone to temperature and time-related drift, making them impractical for most applications. Over time, however, MOSFETs became faster, more stable, and highly reliable, eventually becoming the cornerstone of modern electronics.

The following are a few major discoveries and inventions along the timeline, making modern-day MOSFET and CMOS technology possible: 

1. **Electronics theory of semiconductors – Alan Wilson:**

   * Described the principles of electrical conductivity in semiconductors, laying the theoretical foundation for modern integrated circuit (VLSI) technology.

2. **Controlled silicon impurification and p–n junction formation – Russell Ohl:**

   * Demonstrated the process of doping and the creation of p–n junctions, which are fundamental to the operation of all modern transistors.

3. **Bipolar transistor design with junctions – Shockley, Bardeen & Brattain:**

   * Developed the structure and operation principles of the first practical bipolar junction transistors.

4. **Technological processes of diffusion and oxidation – Calvin Fuller & Carl Frosch:**

   * Introduced controlled diffusion for precise doping and thermal oxidation for the growth of SiO₂ layers on silicon wafers, both critical steps in semiconductor fabrication.

5. **Photolithographic technique – Jules Andrus & Walter L. Bond:**

   * Pioneered the method of transferring circuit patterns from a mask onto silicon wafers using light-sensitive photoresist, enabling precise microfabrication.

6. **Planar process – Jean Hoerni:**

   * Developed a transformative technique for fabricating transistors beneath a protective SiO₂ layer, greatly improving reliability and manufacturability.

7. **Monolithic integrated circuit – Robert Noyce:**

   * Invented the method to integrate multiple transistors, resistors, and interconnects on a single silicon chip, forming the basis of modern VLSI systems.
