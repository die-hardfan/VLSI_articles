# The Verification Mindset: Ensuring First-Time-Right Silicon

The Semiconductor industry is at the forefront of human innovation. As semiconductor designs grow denser and more heterogeneous — with billions of transistors interacting across analog, digital, and mixed-signal domains — ensuring a ‘First-Time-Right’ silicon has never been harder. Verification is the first safeguard, catching design flaws before they escape into silicon. This article only touches the tip of the humongous iceberg that is chip verification.

## The Meaning of Verification

Verification is the process of ensuring any given design meets/adheres to the given specs (or specifications). In short, it's the first attempt at answering the question:
> _Does this design do what it's intended to do?_

First attempt because, throughout the chip design and manufacturing flow, there are multiple points where it's mandatory to pause and ask this question. For example, _verification_, _validation_, and _testing_ all ensure the adherence to spec, just at different stages and with different expectations.

>  Verification is a process in which a design is tested (or verified) against a given design specification before tape-out.

It handles the chip design in its soft copy (software) only. Hence, sometimes called **Pre-silicon validation**. 

>  Validation is a process in which the manufactured design (chip) is tested for all functional correctness in a lab setup.

This is done using the real chip assembled on a test board or a reference board along with all other components part of the system for which the chip was designed for, so that all the use cases possible of the chip when truly deployed can be tested in real time. 

>  Testing (Manufacturing/Production test) involves screening manufactured chips for faults or random defects, reliability, functional defects and electrical characterization before volume shipment.

This involves the post-assembly functional, mechanical, electrical, etc., testing, the success of which marks the end of the current chip design and manufacturing flow. Of course, the maintenance comes next, but that is largely software, and little can be done to correct any mistakes unless all the deployed products are recalled. 
ASICs are effectively frozen once fabricated, so any flaw can require costly respins or recalls. FPGAs are reconfigurable, but still need verification, since field updates are often impractical and debugging post-deployment can be difficult.

## The Significance of Verification and the Concept of First-Time-Right Silicon

Verification is like a feedback system. Any improvement or additions to the design must be _searched_ for bugs, syntactical, logical, functional, etc. This is reported to the design team for modifications, and the process repeats. 
Hence, the design and verification of a chip (or an IC) happen in parallel. Rectification of bugs found earlier in the chip design flow costs less compared to those found at the end. This is largely due to the increasing details as we go lower in the abstraction levels.
For example, a simulation error is solved by changing the RTL code, which takes less time. But a timing violation (during STA) requires a relatively longer time and more effort to be solved (a setup failure, for instance, requires a redesign of the logic or other techniques to decrease the delay).  
Understandably, surveys (e.g., 2024 Siemens EDA / Wilson Research Group Functional Verification Study) indicate that 60–70% of engineering effort in chip projects belongs in verification. Even after that, the possibility of bugs is not null since due to time constraints, verification cannot be extensive or exhaustive.
Bugs uncovered pose risks of functional failure, particularly so in critical systems like automotives, defense systems. This, in turn, results in loss of revenue and reputation for the company. Sufficient to say, _verification_ becomes one of the crucial components responsible to make or break the chips (and the companies).
